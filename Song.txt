Suddenly, I think I always knew
I had my share of mistakes, made quite a few
Finally, I know and that's for sure
I don't look back in anger anymore

Suddenly, the sun comes up again
There's a new beginning when we pass the end
Finally I know and that's for sure
I don't look back in anger anymore

When love kills love
Will someone rescue me?
When love kills love
It's cutting through so deep
